# Libraries, contexts and hooks:

- React Bootstrap - ![React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/)

The most popular front-end framework, as one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as the UI foundation. Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components.

- React Router 
To control what the user sees depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.

- Axios
To tell the React project to send requests to the API
